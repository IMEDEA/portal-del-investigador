POST-MERGE

DESCRIPTION

    This hook is invoked by git merge, which happens when a git pull is done
    on a local repository. The hook takes a single parameter, a status flag
    specifying whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge.
    This hook cannot affect the outcome of git merge and is not executed,
    if the merge failed due to conflicts.

    Check if a submodule has been added after a merge (or pull) and
    run git submodule update

HOWTO
    
    cd {PROJECT_ROOT}   # Project's Root Directory (the one containing .git/)
    cp githooks/post-merge .git/hooks/
    chmod +x .git/hooks/post-merge
